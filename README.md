Hello Speci-fi Employee, and welcome to the rest of your life!
You are reading this because you are smart and know what to do in order to please the higher-ups!
To get you started here are some very basic commands within our special OS:

-ls
"Seem familiar? If not, this command allows you to list the files present within the system. Nifty."

-back
"Pretty straightforward, this command allows you to head back to the menu."

-code X
"code is a command that allows you to enter a specific code so that a specific function is performed! Replace the <X> with whatever value you need."

// More instructions to come... //

Here at Speci-fi, we take our security very seriously. The specimens that we have at our facilities are all kept in secure containment. We would not want an outbreak to occur, as that would lead to many casualties! Please be sure to read this manual thoroughly so that your time spent here as an employee is not one that is spent foolishly.
